odds-and-ends
=============

Odds and ends that don't belong anywhere else, "heritage" microprojects for posterity.

Most of these are things I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole again, but this is a nice enough 
place to share and back them up.

a2ps-web
--------

Perl CGI script for uploading and invoking a2ps + PDF conversion. At my first job we did code
reviews on paper around a table, and this was put together to facilitate printing C++ and Java
code in our standard format.

So thankful for pull requests and their ilk in the modern day.
